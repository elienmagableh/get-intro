# What is CSS?
** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage. With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out

# CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:
1. Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements
2. Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
3. External - by using a <link> element to link to an external CSS file

The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.
# CSS Colors, Fonts and Sizes
- The CSS color property defines the text color to be used.

- The CSS font-family property defines the font to be used.

- The CSS font-size property defines the text size to be used.

# about css 
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside 
its own box and uses rules to indicate how that 
element should look.
 Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the 
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that 
indicate what these elements should look like).
 Different types of selectors allow you to target your 
rules at different elements.
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties 
of the element that you want to change, and the values 
of those properties. For example, the font-family 
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial 
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface. *
