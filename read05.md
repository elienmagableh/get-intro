# comparison operator 
**Comparison operators are used in logical statements to determine equality or difference between variables or values In JavaScript, there are a number of comparison operators that you can use to evaluate whether given values are different or equal, as well as if a value is greater than or less than another. Often, these operators are used with stored values in variables.**

Comparison operators all return a Boolean (logical) value of true or false. 
type of operator 
- ==	equal to
- ===	equal value and equal type
- !=	not equal
- !==	not equal value or not equal type
- >	greater than
- < less than 
- >=	greater than or equal to

* Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result *

# Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values In JavaScript, there are three logical operators, which connect two or more programming statements to return a true (also called “truthy”) or false (“falsy”) value. These are most often used with Boolean (logical) types, but can be applied to values of any data type.
