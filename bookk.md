# writing script 
To write a script, you need to first
state your goal and then list theo
tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking
about them too much, for example you might be
able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email
without a set of detailed instructions. But the first
time we do these things they can seem daunting.
Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break
it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at
a time. With experience these individual tasks grow
familiar and seem simpler.
Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing
when you have finished this book will be quite
complicated and might look intimidating at
first. However, a script is just a series of short
instructions, each of which is performed in order
to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a
script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a
computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.
